He also worked with Mondex, part of the Mastercard suite of smart card companies. Raymond opted for early retirement before emigrating to Vancouver in 1991 to enjoy life and spend more time with his family. In 2003, he was diagnosed with melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer and subsequently underwent life-saving surgery. This proved to be a cathartic experience, leading from concern for his family, particularly his young grandchildren, to a realization that the best way to safeguard their future was to protect the environment. Eager to create lasting change, Raymond came out of retirement and applied his business acumen and experience to founding and running HeroesToo Foundation. He is an affiliate member of the Hong Kong Business Environment Council.</p> <p>E-mail: <a style= 'color: white;' href='mailto:raymond@heroestoo.com'> raymond@heroestoo.com</a></p> <p {text-decoration: none}>Phone: (852) 6403-0208</p><br><h4>Ka-Lun To</h4><h5>Director of HeroesToo Foundation</h5><p>Ka-Lun, or KL as he is better known, is a District Councillor in Hong Kong for Yuen Long.
